# MoistureFarmer
An experimental *sand*box in agentic AI. A thrilling simulator where you play the exciting life of a moisture farmer on a distant desert planet. If you can automate enough of your daily tasks with your droid companions, maybe you'll have enough time to visit Tosche Station this weekend!

## Getting Started

```
cd code
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash start_webgui.sh
```

Then in a browser, navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000

Still highly experimental. Been working on the GUI lately, so agentic loops are currently disconnected -- to be reconnected soon!
