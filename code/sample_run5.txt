######## End of setup ########
 Assistant:  Since my battery level is at 50%, which is above 30%, I do not need to recharge myself at this moment. The vaporator's battery level is also at 50%, which is above 90%, so I do not need to charge it either. I should move to the power station to check if there are any other pieces of equipment that need charging. However, since the vaporator is within 25 meters and my battery is sufficient, I will first move to the vaporator to see if it needs charging.

Let's move to the vaporator.
